## Find the positive leg of an LED

An LED has a **positive** leg and a **negative** leg. The long leg is positive and the short leg is negative.

**TIP**: Another way to check if a leg is positive or negative is to use your finger to find the flat side of the LED bulb. The **flat side** is on the same side as the **negative** leg.

## Twist the resistor around the positive leg of the LED

Bend one of the legs of the resistor around the positive leg of the LED.

Twist the resistor leg around the LED leg around three times.

## Secure the resistor with electrical tape

Cut a small piece of electrical tape and stick it around the twisted resistor. This will help to make it a bit more secure.

## Attach the two jumper wires

Attach one jumper wire to the other end of the resistor.

Attach the other jumper wire to the negative leg of the LED.

**TIP**: If they are quite loose then add some more electrical tape across the joins.
